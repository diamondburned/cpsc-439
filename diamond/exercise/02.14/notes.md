Basically, for each element in $\mathbb{N}$, there exists at most one sequence
in $\mathbb{Z}^*$ that maps to it.

Formally, there exists $M: \mathbb{Z}^* \to \mathbb{N}$ where $(n) \mapsto n$.

Just to clarify, the only reason why I think my solution works is because it
only asks for a one-to-one mapping (or that's what I understand a "one-one-map"
to be). Given that for each output in $\mathbb{N}$ there is at most one
input in $\mathbb{Z}^*$ that maps to it, the mapping is one-to-one.

Prove that the AON-circ language is "equivalent in computing power" to logic
gate diagrams.

Proof by construction:

- Program: construct circuit by connecting gates in order.
- Circuit: topological sort into layers, listing instructions for each layer.

Show that a set of operations is universal (we'll implement NAND).

Example: show that NOR is universal.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\neg (a \land b) &= \neg a \lor \neg b \\
                 &= \neg (\neg (\neg a \lor \neg b))
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $\text{NOT}(a) = \text{NOR}(a, a)$:

| a | b | $\text{NOR}(a, b)$ |
|---|---|--------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 1                  |
| 0 | 1 | 0                  |
| 1 | 0 | 0                  |
| 1 | 1 | 0                  |

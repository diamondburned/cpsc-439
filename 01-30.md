### Definitions --

- Theorem: Proof (not obvious, non-trivial) (**Big Idea!!**)
- Lemma: Theorem but it's used to prove other theorems (usually simpler)
- Claim: Can prove, not gonna bother
- Corollary: Follow from theorem

### Discussion Questions from Week 1

- Proofs & Big-O:
  - concerns the scaling rate between input size and runtime
  - $$f(n) <= c * g(n) \hspace{4pt} for \hspace{4pt} n >= N_0$$
  - Big-O <=
  - Little-O (o) <
  - Big-Theta ($\theta$) =
  - Little-Omega($\omega$) >
  - Big-Omega ($\Omega$) >=
  - $$P \subseteq NP$$

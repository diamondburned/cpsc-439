# Monday 1/30 - Notes

#### Author: Justin

### Definitions --

- Theorem: Proof (not obvious, non-trivial) (**Big Idea!!**)
- Lemma: Theorem but it's used to prove other theorems (usually simpler)
- Claim: Can prove, not gonna bother
- Corollary: Follow from theorem

### Discussion Questions from Week 1

#### Big-O:

- concerns the scaling rate between input size and runtime
- $f(n) <= c * g(n) \hspace{4pt} for \hspace{4pt} n >= N_0$
- Big-O <=
- Little-O (o) <
- Big-Theta ($\theta$) =
- Little-Omega($\omega$) >
- Big-Omega ($\Omega$) >=
- $P \subseteq NP$

#### Types of Proof

- Proof by Induction
  - Starting point (base case)
  - Assume true for some value $N$
  - Prove true for $N + 1$
- Proof by Contradiction
  - Assume opposite is true (of what you're trying to prove)
  - Through deduction, show contradiction (impossibility)
    - Made a mistake
    - Assumption was false which proves truthy-ness of original claim
  -
- Proof by Construction
  - Show truth through example (Proof of Existence)
  - Provide an algorithm to allow anyone to construct an example (**Proof by Python**)
  - Functions proved by contradiction _can't_ be computed

#### Turing Machine Review

- One large tape, write 1's and 0's, move around
- We will be writing some code to run a turing machine
